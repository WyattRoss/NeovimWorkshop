# Why (Neo)Vim?
- Easy to use on a remote server.
- You'll be more inclined to use terminal tools.
- Vim motions are faster (use them, even if you don't switch to nvim).
- Lua configuration is nice.

# Why not a pre-existing spin?
- Maximum look and feel customization.
- Easier to extend on your own.
- If something breaks, you're more likely to know why.
- It's fun :)

# What do we need?
- A color scheme.
- A plugin manager.
    - LSP
    - A fuzzy finder
    - Autocompletion
    - A popup terminal (nice to have)
